# Development setup for charger offchain worker

## Accounts

### Generate charger account

Use [subkey](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey) to generate a new keypair:

```
subkey generate
```
### Charger organization

By default, Alice account is configurated as Organization Owner for chargers.

## Start the substrate node

To start with debug logs:

```
cargo run -- -lpallet_charge_session=debug,charger_service=debug --dev
```

## Transfer units to charger account

With the substrate node running, make a transfer of 1 unit to Account ID of the charger (output of the `subkey generate` command).

## Add the charger account to the chargeur organization

Using Alice account, add the Account Id of the charger in the Alice's organization

## Register the charger account in the keystore
